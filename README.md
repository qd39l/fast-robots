# Fast Robots Web
#### **Owen Deng | qd39@cornell.edu**

## General
The purpose of this repo is to host a Github web page for ECE 5960: Design and implementation of fast robots. ECE 5960 is a course taught at Cornell in SP2022 semester by Professor Kirstin Petersen.

This course includes significant lab work (design and *implementation* of fast robots). The Github web page is the place where I will document my lab progress with text, pseudo-code, photos, videos. The teaching team will also grade these "lab reports." 

The idea is to document **all steps** for each lab. I'll try to avoid making it long and verbose...

Enjoy!
